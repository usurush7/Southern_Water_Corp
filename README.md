# Southern_Water_Corp

This is the Southern Water Corp. Case Study.
During my studies, I was able to perform Descriptive Analysis, Create Quartiles, Identify Outliers, and Create a box plot without outliers. 
Additionally, I was able to create a Plot for Pump Failures Over a Rolling Time Period. 

In the last part, I worked on Inferential Statistical Analysis. 
Using the Seaborn package, I created a heatmap function that clearly shows the correlations (R) for all variables using the dataframe dataset. 
Moreover, I was able to create a Rolling Standard Deviation Heatmap.
